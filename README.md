A web application for online judge(algorithm questions), build with MERN stack(MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJs).

## ✨ Features

- 🔗 Separated backend and frontend.
- 🧑‍💻 User-friendly interface for solving and submitting coding problems.
- 📚 Problem management for admins (create, edit, delete problems).
- 🔐 User authentication and role-based access control.
- 📦 Fully containerized with Docker Compose for easy deployment.
- 🖥️ Dedicated Admin Dashboard included

## 🧩 Limitations
- ❗ Currently supports only basic problem types (input/output-based).
- 🔐 Code is not executed inside a secure sandbox; Docker is used, but additional isolation layers (e.g., gVisor, seccomp, AppArmor) are not implemented.
- 🧵 No job queue system (like Redis or RabbitMQ): simultaneous judging requests may cause error.

	```
	### Server Service
	```env
	NODE_ENV=         # Environment for server [production | development]

 	PORT=             # Port for the Server service (default 8080)

 	CLIENT_URL=       # Frontend URL (default http://localhost:5173)

	ADMIN_URL=        # Admin dashboard URL (default http://localhost:5174)

	JUDGER_URL=       # Judger service URL (default http://localhost:8090)

	JWT_SECRET=       # Secret key for JWT

	HASH_SALT=        # Salt for hashing passwords (set a custom value for security)

	DATABASE_URL=     # MongoDB URL for the database (default mongodb://localhost:27017/FloatPoint)

	MAILTRAP_TOKEN=   # Mailtrap API token (for email testing)

	CLOUD_NAME=       # Cloudinary cloud name

	CLOUD_KEY=        # Cloudinary API key

	CLOUD_SECRET=     # Cloudinary API secret
	```
	### Client Service
	```env
	VITE_API_URL=     # Backend API URL for the client (default http://localhost:8080)
	```
	### Admin Dashboard Service
	```env
	VITE_API_URL=     # Backend API URL (default: http://localhost:8080/)
	VITE_CLIENT_URL=  # App client (not Admin Dashboard) (default: http://localhost:5173/)
	```

3. **Start services**
	### Manual start
